# Project Context

- **Owner:** Sebastien
- **Project:** CopilotCliIde — A Visual Studio extension (VSIX) bridging GitHub Copilot CLI's /ide command with Visual Studio via MCP over named pipes. Three C# projects: CopilotCliIde (VS extension, net472), CopilotCliIde.Server (MCP server, net10.0), CopilotCliIde.Shared (contracts, netstandard2.0).
- **Stack:** C#, .NET, MSBuild, VSSDK, StreamJsonRpc, MCP, Windows named pipes
- **Created:** 2026-03-05

## Core Context

**Alignment & Protocol:** VS Code's Copilot CLI /ide implementation differs in 5 areas: (1) `get_vscode_info` response schema; (2) `get_selection` field names & nesting; (3) `get_diagnostics` structure (grouped by file, includes range/source/code); (4) `open_diff` resolution values (must be uppercase "SAVED"/"REJECTED" with trigger field); (5) `close_diff` response casing (snake_case). See `.squad/decisions.md` "MCP Tool Schemas & Compatibility" for full details. Key alignments completed: uppercase open_diff values, 200ms selection debounce, diagnostics_changed push notifications, PathUtils URI enforcement.

**Architecture Update (2026-03-29):** Bishop completed AspNet transport baseline refactor. MCP server switched from custom HTTP/MCP stack to ModelContextProtocol.AspNetCore using Kestrel named-pipe hosting. Extension code unchanged — RpcClient connection and callbacks work identically. See `.squad/decisions.md` "Decision: ModelContextProtocol.AspNetCore Transport Baseline" for full scope.

**Architecture Patterns:** Selection & diagnostics tracking follow callback-driven IoC pattern in `SelectionTracker.cs` and `DiagnosticTracker.cs`. Diagnostics feed from two sources: (1) `ITableDataSink` (real-time Roslyn notifications via 14-member interface), (2) Error List reader (on-demand via DTE or periodic). Both converge on `DebouncePusher` with 200ms debounce + content dedup. LogError destinations: `~/.copilot/ide/vs-error-{pid}.log` (errors) and `vs-connection-{pid}.log` (lifecycle).

**Team Rules:** (1) File URIs MUST use `PathUtils.ToVsCodeFileUrl()` + `PathUtils.ToLowerDriveLetter()`, never raw `Uri.ToString()` — enforces protocol requirement (lowercase drive, URL-encoded colon). (2) Severity mapping via `vsBuildErrorLevel.ToProtocolSeverity()` extension method (canonical, centralized). (3) Code style via `npm run format` locally + `npm run format:check` in CI (Husky pre-commit hook for verification). (4) All team members run `dotnet test` before pushing server changes — tool name tests enforce MCP schema compatibility.

**Build & Test:** Extension builds with MSBuild (not dotnet build): `msbuild src/CopilotCliIde/CopilotCliIde.csproj /p:Configuration=Debug`. Server: `dotnet build src/CopilotCliIde.Server/`. Tests: `dotnet test src/CopilotCliIde.Server.Tests/` (153 tests, xUnit v3, Central Package Management). VSIX deployment requires real MSBuild (dotnet msbuild limitation).

## Learnings

<!-- Append new learnings below. Each entry is something lasting about the project. -->

### 2026-07-19 — Contextual Tool Result Logging in VsServiceRpc

Enhanced all 6 tool methods in `VsServiceRpc.cs` to log result details, matching the richness of push event logging in SelectionTracker and DiagnosticTracker.

**Pattern:** Single log line per tool invocation at RESULT time (not invocation time), except `open_diff` which keeps both (since it blocks for a long time). Arrow `→` prefix visually links to the tool name.

**Log formats implemented:**
- `Tool get_selection → VsServiceRpc.cs L96:1` / `→ (no editor)` — mirrors SelectionTracker line 194 format exactly
- `Tool get_diagnostics → 1 file(s), 2 diagnostic(s)` / `→ error: {msg}` — mirrors DiagnosticTracker line 160 format
- `Tool get_vscode_info → SolutionName, 3 project(s)` / `→ (no solution)`
- `Tool open_diff: tabName (file)` (invocation) + `→ SAVED (accepted_via_button)` (result) / `→ error: {msg}`
- `Tool close_diff → closed` / `→ already closed` / `→ error: {msg}`
- `Tool read_file → Program.cs (42 total, 20 returned)` / `→ error: {msg}`

**Key implementation notes:**
- `Path.GetFileName()` used for file names in logs (not full paths, matching push style)
- Selection log uses 1-based line/col (adds 1 to 0-based DTO values), matching push format
- Null-safe throughout — `?.` and `?? 0` operators prevent crashes in logging
- Error paths log with `→ error:` prefix for grep-ability

**Build:** Server compiles clean (0 errors, 0 warnings). Formatter clean.

### 2026-07-19 — Log Format Consistency & DisplayColumn Fix

Fixed two inconsistencies in `VsServiceRpc.cs`:

**1. Separator character:** Changed all tool log lines from `Tool {name} → {details}` to `Tool {name}: {details}`, matching the push event format (`Push selection_changed: ...`). The `→` arrow is now reserved exclusively for position ranges (`L1:5 → L1:20`), eliminating visual ambiguity.

**2. DisplayColumn vs LineCharOffset:** `GetSelectionAsync` was using `sel.TopPoint.DisplayColumn` which expands tabs to their visual width (e.g. tab=4 columns). SelectionTracker uses buffer offsets where tab=1 character. Switched to `sel.TopPoint.LineCharOffset` (1-based character offset, tab=1) so both paths produce identical column numbers. Key DTE property differences:
- `DisplayColumn`: visual column (tabs expanded to tab-width). Good for cursor display.
- `LineCharOffset`: 1-based character position on the line (tab = 1 char). Matches buffer offset math.
- `VirtualCharOffset`: includes virtual whitespace beyond line end.

**Build:** Server compiles clean (0 errors, 0 warnings). Formatter clean.

### 2026-07-19 — Extension Code Review (CopilotCliIde)

Completed a thorough review of all 11 source files in `src/CopilotCliIde/`. Key structural observations:

**Threading model:** All VS service calls correctly switch to UI thread. `SelectionTracker` captures data on UI thread and pushes via `Task.Run` off-thread. `DebouncePusher` timer callbacks run on thread pool. `DiagnosticTracker` uses `JoinableTaskFactory.RunAsync` to marshal back to UI for snapshot collection.

**Resource lifecycle:** `StopConnection()` is the central teardown point — disposes CTS, RPC, pipe, process, lock file. Called from solution close, solution switch, and package Dispose. `VsServiceRpc` instance created by `JsonRpc.Attach` is NOT explicitly disposed — its `_activeDiffs` dictionary survives RPC teardown.

**Key files and their roles:**
- `CopilotCliIdePackage.cs`: Package lifecycle, solution events, pipe setup (245 lines)
- `SelectionTracker.cs`: IWpfTextView tracking + debounced push (195 lines)
- `VsServiceRpc.cs`: All 6 tool implementations + diff InfoBar flow (398 lines)
- `DiagnosticTracker.cs`: Error List table subscription + push (264 lines)
- `DiagnosticTableSink.cs`: ITableDataSink 14-member impl (122 lines)
- `DebouncePusher.cs`: Reusable 200ms debounce + dedup (36 lines)
- `IdeDiscovery.cs`: Lock file CRUD + stale cleanup (106 lines)
- `ServerProcessManager.cs`: Child process start/kill (56 lines)

**Active diffs are the biggest lifecycle gap:** When `StopConnection()` fires (solution switch), pending `TaskCompletionSource` instances in `VsServiceRpc._activeDiffs` are orphaned. InfoBars remain visible. Temp files are not cleaned.

### 2026-03-10 — VS Extension Improvement Scan & Formal Review

Completed comprehensive review of all 11 source files in `src/CopilotCliIde/`. Produced formal findings report with 2 HIGH, 3 MEDIUM, 9 LOW findings. Report merged to `.squad/decisions.md` "Review Findings — 2026-03-10" section.

**HIGH-priority findings:**
- **HIGH-1 (Active diff cleanup on teardown):** VsServiceRpc._activeDiffs dictionary survives when RPC is disposed during StopConnection. TCS instances orphaned. Impact: pending diffs never complete, MCP server hangs, InfoBars persist, temp files leaked.
- **HIGH-2 (DebouncePusher TOCTOU race):** Two concurrent calls to Schedule() can both see _timer==null, both create timers, one leaks. Affects DiagnosticTracker where SchedulePush is called from arbitrary threads.

**MEDIUM-priority findings:**
- CancellationTokenSource leak in OpenDiffAsync (missing dispose in catch)
- Stale lock file cleanup TOCTOU (deletes mid-write)
- GetSelectionAsync vs SelectionTracker API mismatch (DTE vs native)
- ServerProcessManager Task.Delay(200) readiness fragility

**Cross-references:** HIGH-1 aligns with Ripley's H3 (diff cleanup race). HIGH-2 = Ripley H1 (threading hazard). M3 (GetSelectionAsync) relates to Hudson's extension test coverage gaps. Multiple findings reinforce silent catch block pattern (Ripley H4).

**Decision:** Report filed. Ready for sprint planning and cross-team coordination.

### 2026-03-28 — Shared DiagnosticSeverity constants for extension mapping

Diagnostic severities used by extension diagnostics mapping are now centralized in `CopilotCliIde.Shared.Contracts` via `DiagnosticSeverity` (`Error`, `Warning`, `Information`). `DiagnosticTracker` maps `__VSERRORCATEGORY` to these constants with the same fallback behavior (`Information`) so wire values and protocol behavior stay unchanged while removing local string literals.

### 2026-07-20 — Fix stale file name when all editors close

**Bug:** When all editor tabs were closed (solution still loaded), Copilot CLI continued showing the last opened file name. `SelectionTracker.UntrackView()` nulled `_trackedView` and unsubscribed events but never pushed a "cleared" notification to the MCP server, so the server's cached push state retained the stale file name.

**Fix in `SelectionTracker.cs`:**
- Added `PushClearedSelection()` — schedules a `SelectionNotification` with all-null fields (no file, no selection) through the existing 200ms debouncer with dedup key `"cleared"`.
- Called from `TrackActiveView` when `wpfView == null` (non-editor frame becomes active, e.g., Solution Explorer).
- Called from `OnViewClosed` (editor tab closed) as belt-and-suspenders — covers timing gaps where SEID_WindowFrame may not fire immediately.
- Updated `OnDebounceElapsed` logging: cleared notifications log as `Push selection_changed: (no editor)`, matching the `get_selection` tool log format.

**Key design decisions:**
- Push goes through `DebouncePusher` (not bypassed) so rapid close+reopen doesn't spam the server.
- Dedup key `"cleared"` prevents duplicate cleared pushes when both OnViewClosed and SEID_WindowFrame fire.
- `PushClearedSelection` checks `_getCallbacks() == null` first — safe at startup when RPC isn't connected yet.
- The polled path (`VsServiceRpc.GetSelectionAsync`) was already correct — `dte.ActiveDocument` returns null when no editor is open.

## Cross-Agent Context — Session 2026-04-12

### Terminal Subsystem Code Review Delivery (PR #7)

Completed comprehensive review of all new files in "feat: Embedded Copilot CLI tool window" PR. Found **2 critical bugs** requiring immediate fixes before release:

1. **UTF-8 multi-byte character corruption (TerminalProcess.cs:103)** — Must replace `Encoding.UTF8.GetString()` with stateful `Decoder` to handle characters split across 4096-byte buffer boundaries.

2. **Focus recovery broken (TerminalToolWindowControl.cs:58)** — Script references nonexistent `window.term`. IIFE creates local `terminal` but never exposes on `window`. Fix: add `window.term = terminal;` in terminal-app.js.

**Important issues (4):** Volatile flag, WebView2 error UI, TerminalSessionService thread sync, ResizeObserver for dock panel resizes.

**Ownership established:** Hicks team charter updated to include terminal subsystem. Terminal routing added to `.squad/routing.md`.

### From Hudson (Test Coverage Assessment)

Hudson assessed ~500 LOC new code with zero test coverage. Priorities:

1. **Create CopilotCliIde.Tests project** — Prerequisite for any extension code testing (flagged since 2026-03-10).
2. **TerminalSessionService is highest-value test target** — 90 LOC, testable with factory extraction, no WebView2/VS dependencies.
3. **TerminalProcess needs integration tests** — Requires Windows CI with ConPTY support.

Recommended minimum viable testing: 8-10 unit tests for TerminalSessionService + 2-3 integration tests for TerminalProcess state machine.

### From Ripley (Documentation Standards)

Ripley completed full documentation audit post-PR#7. Updated:
- copilot-instructions.md with dedicated terminal subsystem section
- CHANGELOG.md with PR #7 feature entry
- README.md Usage section with both terminal options
- team.md dependencies (WebView2, ConPTY, xterm.js)

Established expectation: all future feature PRs include documentation updates to copilot-instructions.md, CHANGELOG.md, README.md before merge.

**Cross-team approval (2026-03-30):** Hudson reviewed and approved the fix. Added 3 comprehensive regression tests covering: (1) pull path when no editor active, (2) push path receives cleared notification, (3) consistency between both paths. All 285 tests passing (282 existing + 3 new).

### 2026-07-20 — Fix cleared selection event timing (bad `OnViewClosed` push)

**Bug:** The previous fix (2026-07-20 above) called `PushClearedSelection()` from both `OnViewClosed` and `TrackActiveView(null)`. The `OnViewClosed` call fires for every tab close — including intermediate closes where VS is about to focus another editor. In a 3-file workspace, closing all tabs emitted 3 cleared events when only the final one was correct.

**Root cause:** `OnViewClosed` fires during the view close, *before* VS resolves the next active window. Emitting cleared here is premature — VS will fire `SEID_WindowFrame` moments later with the actual next active frame.

**Fix:** Removed `PushClearedSelection()` from `OnViewClosed`. It now only calls `UntrackView()`. The cleared event is emitted solely from `TrackActiveView` (driven by `SEID_WindowFrame`) when `wpfView == null` — meaning VS has confirmed no editor is active.

**Event ordering (verified):** When a tab closes: (1) `IWpfTextView.Closed` fires → `OnViewClosed` → untrack only. (2) VS picks next active frame → `SEID_WindowFrame` fires → `TrackActiveView` → either tracks new editor (normal selection push) or pushes cleared (last tab). This gives exactly one cleared event when the workspace becomes empty.

**Build:** Server compiles clean. All 285 tests pass.

## Cross-Agent Context — Session 2026-03-30

**From Hudson:** Approved the revised fix. Added 3 regression tests covering 3-file workflow, server transparency, and single-file edge case. All 288 tests passing.

**From Ripley:** Identified the original regression commit `3d17a6f` (2026-03-05 09:49) which removed `PushEmptySelection()` under the incorrect assumption "copilot-cli ignores empty file paths." Your fix (with dual-emit guard in OnViewClosed removed) is the correct implementation.

### 2026-07-20 — Fix ServerProcessManager WorkingDirectory (Issue #4)

**Bug:** `ServerProcessManager.StartAsync` launched the MCP server via `dotnet` without setting `WorkingDirectory` in `ProcessStartInfo`. The child process inherited VS's working directory (the open solution/project folder). If that folder contained an `appsettings.json` with Kestrel HTTPS endpoint config, Kestrel threw `System.InvalidOperationException: Call UseKestrelHttpsConfiguration()...` and the process exited immediately — the named pipe was never created.

**Fix:** Added `WorkingDirectory = serverDir` to the `ProcessStartInfo` block. The `serverDir` variable (`McpServer/` under the extension install directory) was already computed on line 13. That directory contains only the published server DLL and dependencies — no `appsettings.json` — so Kestrel starts with its default in-memory configuration.

**Key takeaway:** Child processes launched from VS extensions inherit the solution's working directory, not the extension's install directory. Always set `WorkingDirectory` explicitly when launching helper processes to avoid environment contamination from user projects.

## Cross-Agent Context — Session 2026-03-31

**From Hudson:** Wrote 2 regression tests for issue #4 in ServerWorkingDirectoryTests.cs. All 284 tests passing (282 existing + 2 new). Tests cover: (1) Server starts cleanly with correct WorkingDirectory; (2) Server would have crashed with hostile appsettings.json in inherited directory (regression test).

### 2026-07-20 — Terminal Subsystem Code Review (PR #7)

Reviewed all new/modified files from "feat: Embedded Copilot CLI tool window" PR. Full review filed to `.squad/decisions/inbox/hicks-terminal-review.md`.

**Architecture (new files):**
- `ConPty.cs` — P/Invoke wrapper for Windows ConPTY APIs (CreatePseudoConsole, ResizePseudoConsole, etc.). Includes `Session` IDisposable class managing all native handles with correct teardown order.
- `TerminalProcess.cs` — Manages CLI process via ConPTY. Background read thread + 16ms output batching timer. Clean Dispose with thread join outside lock.
- `TerminalSessionService.cs` — Package-level singleton surviving tool window hide/show. Manages terminal process lifecycle. Registered on `VsServices.Instance.TerminalSession`.
- `TerminalToolWindow.cs` — `ToolWindowPane` shell with `PreProcessMessage` override for keyboard passthrough. Docked tabbed with Output window.
- `TerminalToolWindowControl.cs` — WPF `UserControl` + WebView2 + xterm.js bridge. Deferred init at `ApplicationIdle` priority. Attaches/detaches from session service.
- `Resources/Terminal/` — HTML/JS/CSS for xterm.js frontend. IIFE-scoped JS, debounced resize, WebView2 messaging bridge.

**Critical findings (2):**
1. **UTF-8 multi-byte corruption** (`TerminalProcess.cs:103`): `Encoding.UTF8.GetString()` doesn't handle characters split across `ReadFile` boundaries. Must use `Decoder` with persistent state.
2. **Focus script references nonexistent `window.term`** (`TerminalToolWindowControl.cs:58`): The JS IIFE creates local `terminal` variable, never exposed on `window`. Click-to-focus recovery after F5 is broken.

**Important findings (4):**
1. `_webViewReady` not volatile — read cross-thread without synchronization.
2. No user-facing error when WebView2 runtime missing — stuck "Loading" message.
3. `TerminalSessionService` has no thread synchronization on `_process`.
4. JS uses `window.resize` only — misses VS dock panel splitter resizes (needs `ResizeObserver`).

**Key patterns learned:**
- ConPTY session start deferred until xterm.js sends first resize — avoids dimension mismatch.
- Terminal lifecycle independent of MCP connection lifecycle — no shared state.
- `ProvideToolWindow(Transient = true)` means tool window state not persisted across VS restarts.
- WebView2 resources mapped via `SetVirtualHostNameToFolderMapping` with `https://copilot-cli.local/` virtual host.

### 2026-07-20 — Fix 2 Critical Terminal Bugs

**Bug 1: UTF-8 multi-byte character corruption (TerminalProcess.cs)**
- `Encoding.UTF8.GetString(buffer, 0, bytesRead)` is stateless — each call decodes independently. When a multi-byte UTF-8 sequence (emoji, CJK, accented chars) spans two `ReadFile` boundaries, both chunks produce U+FFFD replacement characters.
- **Fix:** Added persistent `Decoder? _utf8Decoder` field, initialized via `Encoding.UTF8.GetDecoder()` in `Start()`. Replaced `GetString()` call in `ReadLoop` with `_utf8Decoder.GetCharCount()` + `_utf8Decoder.GetChars()`. The `Decoder` maintains internal state across calls — incomplete trailing bytes from one read are buffered and completed by the next read.
- **Pattern:** Always use `Decoder` (not `Encoding.GetString`) when decoding streamed byte data that may arrive in arbitrary chunks. This applies to any pipe/socket/serial read loop.

**Bug 2: Broken focus recovery (terminal-app.js)**
- `TerminalToolWindowControl.cs` calls `ExecuteScriptAsync("window.term.focus()")` to recover keyboard focus after F5 debug cycles. But the xterm.js `Terminal` instance was created as local `var terminal` inside an IIFE — `window.term` was `undefined`, so the call silently failed.
- **Fix:** Added `window.term = terminal;` inside the IIFE, just before the click handler registration. Placement is after all addon loading and initial setup, so the exposed instance is fully initialized.
- **Pattern:** When C# needs to call into WebView2 JS via `ExecuteScriptAsync`, the target must be on `window`. IIFE-scoped variables are unreachable from external scripts.

### 2026-07-20 — Fix 4 Important Terminal Issues (Code Review Follow-up)

Fixed all four 🟡 Important issues from the terminal code review.

**Issue 1: `volatile` on `_webViewReady` (TerminalToolWindowControl.cs)**
- Field written on UI thread (DOMContentLoaded callback) and read on thread pool (OnOutputReceived). Without `volatile`, CPU cache coherence not guaranteed under .NET memory model.
- **Fix:** Added `volatile` keyword to field declaration.

**Issue 2: WebView2 graceful fallback (TerminalToolWindowControl.cs)**
- If WebView2 runtime missing, `CreateAsync` or `EnsureCoreWebView2Async` throws. Previously uncaught — would crash via the outer `DeferredInitialize` handler but with a generic message.
- **Fix:** Wrapped both calls in targeted try-catch blocks. On failure: logs clear message with install URL to Output pane, cleans up partial WebView2 state, returns early. Tool window stays at "Loading Copilot CLI…" placeholder — non-functional but non-crashing.
- **Pattern:** Two separate try-catch blocks because `CreateAsync` failure (no runtime) and `EnsureCoreWebView2Async` failure (runtime found but init fails) need different cleanup — the latter must dispose the already-created WebView2 control.

**Issue 3: Thread sync in TerminalSessionService (TerminalSessionService.cs)**
- `StartSession`/`StopSession`/`RestartSession` race when called from UI thread (tool window resize) vs solution events thread (solution close).
- **Fix:** Added `_processLock` object. Extracted `StopSessionCore()` (lock-free inner method) called from `StopSession` and `StartSession` under lock. `RestartSession` locks then delegates to `StartSession` (safe: C# `Monitor` is reentrant for same thread).
- `WriteInput` and `Resize` left lock-free — they delegate to `TerminalProcess` which handles its own thread safety, and brief stale reference is harmless.

**Issue 4: ResizeObserver (terminal-app.js)**
- `window.resize` event doesn't fire when VS dock panel splitter is dragged — only when the outer Chromium window changes size. Terminal could be clipped.
- **Fix:** Added `ResizeObserver` on `#terminal` container element, sharing the existing debounced fit function. Feature-gated with `typeof ResizeObserver !== "undefined"` for safety. Refactored the anonymous resize handler into named `debouncedFit()` function shared by both `window.resize` and `ResizeObserver`.

**Build:** Server 0 errors, 0 warnings. Roslyn validation clean on both C# files.

### 2026-07-20 — Clarify Tools Menu Item Names (External vs Embedded Terminal)

Renamed both Copilot CLI menu items in the Tools menu to eliminate user confusion:
- "Launch Copilot CLI" → **"Copilot CLI (External Terminal)"**
- "Copilot CLI Window" → **"Copilot CLI (Embedded Terminal)"**

Parallel parenthetical naming so both group together and the distinction is obvious at a glance.

**Files changed:**
- `CopilotCliIdePackage.vsct` — ButtonText for both commands
- `TerminalToolWindow.cs` — Caption property (tool window title bar)
- `CopilotCliIdePackage.cs` — log messages and registration comment
- `README.md` — Usage section and tip
- `CHANGELOG.md` — historical menu references
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` — terminal subsystem docs

**Key finding:** Menu item text lives in 3 layers: VSCT ButtonText (menu), ToolWindowPane Caption (title bar), and docs. All must stay in sync. The "Loading Copilot CLI…" placeholder text in TerminalToolWindowControl was left as-is — it's transient loading state, not a navigable menu item.

**Build:** Roslyn validation clean on both C# files. Server builds 0 errors, 0 warnings.

### 2026-07-20 — Terminal redraw/re-fit on tab visibility changes

**Bug:** Two visual bugs where xterm.js didn't recalculate dimensions after the tool window tab regained visibility: (1) solution switch → tab switch → come back showed frozen/stale content; (2) close solution → reopen showed line wrapping artifacts from stale terminal state.

**Root cause:** `OnVisibleChanged` only focused WebView2, never triggered `fitAddon.fit()`. Session restarts (from solution switch) didn't clear xterm.js state.

**Fix — three layers:**
1. **JS (`terminal-app.js`):** Exposed `window.fitTerminal()` (zero-dimension guard + fit + sendResize) and `window.resetTerminal()` (terminal.reset + fit). Added `document.visibilitychange` listener with 100ms delay — WebView2 maps WPF visibility to this API, making it the primary re-fit trigger for tab switches.
2. **C# control (`TerminalToolWindowControl.cs`):** `OnVisibleChanged` now calls `ScheduleFitScript()` via `Dispatcher.BeginInvoke(Background)` as belt-and-suspenders. New `OnSessionRestarted` handler dispatches `resetTerminal()` to clear stale content on restart.
3. **C# service (`TerminalSessionService.cs`):** Added `SessionRestarted` event, fired outside `_processLock` after successful restart to avoid deadlocks.

**Key learnings:**
- WebView2 maps WPF `IsVisible` → `document.visibilityState`. The `visibilitychange` event fires on VS tool window tab switches — reliable primary mechanism.
- `fitAddon.fit()` silently no-ops when container has zero dimensions (returns undefined from `proposeDimensions`). The explicit guard in `fitTerminal()` prevents unnecessary `sendResize` calls.
- `terminal.reset()` clears viewport + scrollback + cursor state — correct choice for session restart. `terminal.clear()` only clears scrollback.
- Events from `TerminalSessionService` should fire outside `_processLock` to prevent deadlocks when handlers access the service.

**Build:** Roslyn validation clean (0 errors, 0 warnings). Formatter clean. All 284 server tests pass.

### 2026-07-20 — Reset terminal on solution close instead of killing it

**Bug:** When a solution closed, `OnSolutionAfterClosing` called `_terminalSession?.StopSession()`, killing the ConPTY process. The tool window tab stayed visible but showed a frozen, uninteractable terminal. Users had to wait for a new solution to load before the terminal became usable again.

**Fix in `CopilotCliIdePackage.cs`:** Replaced `StopSession()` with `RestartSession(fallbackDir)` where `fallbackDir = Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.UserProfile)`. This stops the old ConPTY process and immediately starts a fresh one rooted at `%USERPROFILE%`. The `SessionRestarted` event fires, which the tool window control handles by calling `resetTerminal()` in xterm.js — clearing stale content and re-fitting.

**Why user home dir:** When no solution is loaded, the terminal needs a sensible working directory. `UserProfile` (`C:\Users\<name>`) is the standard shell default on Windows and matches what `cmd.exe` and PowerShell use when launched without a specific path. `Directory.GetCurrentDirectory()` was considered but it inherits VS's process CWD which may be stale or unexpected.

**Lifecycle note:** Terminal session lifecycle is independent from MCP connection lifecycle. `StopConnection()` still runs (tears down pipes, lock file, MCP server), but the terminal keeps running. On next solution open, `RestartSession(GetWorkspaceFolder())` resets it to the new solution directory — same as before.

**Build:** Roslyn validation clean (0 errors, 0 warnings). All 284 server tests pass.
